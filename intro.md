This JupyterBook provides an open-source framework for assessing the risk of critical infrastructure worldwide. By leveraging publicly available datasets and analytical tools, it enables users to evaluate infrastructure exposure, vulnerability, and potential damage due to natural hazards.

This work was supported by the [**Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery**](https://www.gfdrr.org/en).
