# Vulnerability

Vulnerability is a critical determinant in assessing how infrastructure systems are affected by natural hazards. It refers to the susceptibility of critical infrastructure (CI) to damage when exposed to specific hazards. Vulnerability can vary greatly depending on the physical characteristics of infrastructure, the type of hazard, and the intensity of the hazard. This page explores the different dimensions of vulnerability, building upon the work by [Nirandjan et al. (2024)](https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/nhess-2023-208/), which provides a systematic review and database of vulnerability curves for CI assets.

## Defining Vulnerability

The **United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR)** defines vulnerability as "the conditions determined by physical, social, economic, and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets, or systems to the impacts of hazards." This definition underscores the multi-faceted nature of vulnerability, which includes both structural (physical) and non-structural components.

When assessing physical damage to infrastructure due to direct contact with a hazard, **vulnerability curves** and **fragility curves** are commonly used to represent this relationship. These curves illustrate how varying levels of hazard intensity (e.g., flood depth or wind speed) relate to the degree of physical damage.

### Vulnerability Curves
Vulnerability curves quantify the extent of damage that critical infrastructure will likely suffer given a specific hazard intensity. Damage can be expressed in terms of:
- **Absolute terms** (e.g., cost of repair or replacement).
- **Relative terms** (e.g., damage factor), which is the ratio of expected repair costs to the total replacement cost of the infrastructure.

Vulnerability curves are commonly used in flood risk assessments, where inundation depth correlates with the expected damage. These curves are valuable for estimating potential damage costs and guiding infrastructure investments in resilience measures.

### Fragility Curves
Fragility curves express the probability that infrastructure will reach or exceed a certain damage state based on hazard intensity. They are typically used in earthquake risk assessments and focus on qualitative damage states, such as "slight," "moderate," or "complete" damage. These curves help estimate the likelihood of infrastructure failure under various hazard scenarios.

## Systematic Vulnerability Database for Critical Infrastructure

Nirandjan et al. (2024) have developed an open-access **Physical Vulnerability Database for Critical Infrastructure Multi-Hazard Risk Assessments**, which brings together over 1,250 vulnerability and fragility curves for critical infrastructure systems. This dataset is a valuable resource for risk assessments, enabling users to evaluate how CI systems respond to hazards such as:
- **Flooding** (coastal, river, and surface floods)
- **Earthquakes**
- **Windstorms** (tropical and extra-tropical)
- **Landslides** (rainfall- and earthquake-triggered)

The database is particularly important as previous vulnerability data for CI was scattered across various sources, often in formats that restricted direct application. By centralizing these data, Nirandjan et al. have created a standardized and comprehensive resource for estimating damage to infrastructure under different hazard scenarios.


## Gaps and Future Research

Despite significant progress in developing vulnerability data for CI, **Nirandjan et al. (2024)** highlight key gaps that require further research:
- **Telecommunication systems** are underrepresented in the existing vulnerability database, and more work is needed to develop reliable vulnerability curves for these systems.
- There is a need for improved vulnerability data for **low- and middle-income countries**, where infrastructure resilience may be lower due to resource constraints.
- **Multi-hazard interactions** (e.g., the combined effects of flooding and earthquakes) are not sufficiently covered in current vulnerability datasets, despite their growing relevance in the context of climate change and urbanization.
