# Overview of Examples

This page highlights unique calculations and processing techniques applied in the example notebooks, with links for further exploration.

### **1. Vulnerability, Damage, and Risk Assessment**  
[Transport Infrastructure](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/ci/transport.html): A comprehensive example of assessing vulnerability, damage, and risk for transport systems.

### **2. Processing LineStrings and Points to Polygons**  
[Power Infrastructure](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/ci/power.html): Emphasizes that within a single assessment, each object type must use the same geometry type (e.g., polygons, lines) for consistent maximum damage values. If mixed geometries are needed, separate runs with unique maximum damage values per geometry type are required.

### **3. Applying Multi-Curve Assessments**  
[Education Infrastructure](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/ci/education.html#performing-the-damage-assessment): Demonstrates the use of multiple vulnerability curves for all object types, rather than selecting a single curve per type. 

### **4. Post-Processing with Additional Hazard Layers**  
[Earthquake Impact](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/hazard/earthquake.html): Shows how to refine damage assessments using liquefaction hazard data for post-event corrections.

### **5. Present-Day and Future Risk Assessments**  
[Tropical Cyclones](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/hazard/tropical_cyclone.html): Provides a method for comparing current and projected risks due to climate change.

### **6. Country-Wide Exposure Assessments**  
[All Infrastructure Types](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/use_cases/all_ci_exposure.html): Performs exposure assessments for all infrastructure types within a country.

### **7. Country-Wide Vulnerability Assessments**  
[All Infrastructure Types](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/use_cases/all_ci_vulnerability.html): Evaluates vulnerabilities across multiple infrastructure categories.

### **8. Country-Wide Risk Assessments**  
[All Infrastructure Types](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/use_cases/all_ci_risk.html): Conducts comprehensive risk assessments for all infrastructure types.

### **9. Multi-Country Risk Assessment for a Single Infrastructure Type**  
[Multi-Country Analysis](https://vu-ivm.github.io/GlobalInfraRisk/use_cases/multi-country.html): Analyzes risk across multiple countries for a single type of infrastructure.
