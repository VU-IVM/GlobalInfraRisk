# Vulnerability

Vulnerability is a key component in risk assessments, defining the extent to which infrastructure assets are susceptible to damage when exposed to natural hazards. It is influenced by factors such as material strength, structural design, maintenance level, and hazard intensity.

The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (**UNDRR**) defines vulnerability as:  
*‚ÄúThe characteristics and circumstances of a community, system, or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard.‚Äù*

Despite its importance, accurately determining the vulnerability of infrastructure remains a challenge. Many assets lack detailed vulnerability studies, and existing assessments are often based on assumptions, expert judgment, or data from similar regions. The validation of vulnerability relationships requires extensive empirical data, which is often unavailable, making it necessary to rely on literature-based estimates. 

To support infrastructure risk assessments, we use the [**Nirandjan et al. (2024) database**](https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/24/4341/2024/nhess-24-4341-2024.html) as a starting point when local vulnerability or fragility information is unavailable. This dataset provides a collection of standardized vulnerability and fragility curves across different hazard types and infrastructure systems.

## Types of Vulnerability Curves

Two key approaches exist for quantifying infrastructure damage in risk modeling:

### **1. Vulnerability Curves**
Vulnerability curves describe the expected level of damage to an infrastructure asset based on hazard intensity. These curves express damage as a fraction of the total asset value, ranging from 0 (no damage) to 1 (total destruction). 

Vulnerability curves are commonly used for:
- **Flooding** (damage as a function of water depth)
- **Windstorms** (damage as a function of wind speed)
- **Landslides** (damage as a function of ground displacement)

These curves are particularly useful for estimating economic losses, as they provide a direct way to compute expected reconstruction costs based on the level of hazard exposure.

Below is an example of selected vulnerability curves for different infrastructure types under flood hazard:

### **2. Fragility Curves**
Fragility curves describe the probability that an infrastructure asset will exceed a specific damage state at a given hazard intensity. Unlike vulnerability curves, which predict direct damage ratios, fragility curves provide probabilistic estimates for different damage thresholds, such as:
- **Slight Damage** (minor repairs needed)
- **Moderate Damage** (significant functional impairment)
- **Extensive Damage** (structural failure but not complete collapse)
- **Complete Damage** (total destruction)

Fragility curves are most commonly used for:
- **Earthquakes** (damage probability as a function of peak ground acceleration)
- **Windstorms** (damage probability as a function of wind speed)
- **Landslides** (probability of collapse under soil movement)


## The Nirandjan et al. (2024) Vulnerability Database

A comprehensive open-access database developed by [**Nirandjan et al. (2024)**]((https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/24/4341/2024/nhess-24-4341-2024.html)) provides over **1,250 vulnerability and fragility curves** for critical infrastructure across multiple hazard types. The database was compiled through a systematic review of scientific literature and engineering reports, ensuring that the collected curves represent a broad range of hazard intensities and asset types. 

The dataset includes:

- **Hazards covered:** Flooding, earthquakes, windstorms, and landslides.
- **Infrastructure types:** Roads, power plants, telecommunications, buildings, and more.
- **Different structural classifications:** Variations based on material type, size, and function.
- **Geographical applicability:** The curves originate from multiple regions, with a significant portion of data sourced from high-income countries. However, the dataset also includes estimates for low- and middle-income regions where empirical data is scarce.

One of the challenges addressed in the database is the lack of standardized vulnerability curves for certain asset types, such as telecommunications infrastructure. Where empirical data is missing, the database provides modeled estimates based on engineering assumptions and analogues from similar structures. 

The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via Zenodo:  
üì• **[Download the dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/13889558)**  
The page provides an overview of dataset structure and metadata. New versions will be uploaded on the Zenodo database page.

## Using the Database in Notebooks

The section below provides an example on how to read the vulnerablity data from **Nirandjan et al. (2024)**.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset directly from Zenodo
url = "https://zenodo.org/records/10203846/files/Table_D2_Multi-Hazard_Fragility_and_Vulnerability_Curves_V1.0.0.xlsx?download=1"
xls = pd.ExcelFile(url)

# Display available sheets
print(xls.sheet_names)

# Select a vulnerability dataset (e.g., Flooding)
df_vuln = pd.read_excel(xls, sheet_name="F_Vuln_Depth")

# Display first few rows of the dataset
print(df_vuln.head())

# Filtering for specific infrastructure type
df_vuln_filtered = df_vuln[df_vuln["Infrastructure description"].str.contains("power plant", na=False)]

# Display the filtered dataset
print(df_vuln_filtered)
```

This example demonstrates how to retrieve and apply vulnerability curves from the **Nirandjan et al. (2024) database**. The dataset provides a structured foundation for integrating vulnerability curves into risk assessments. However, validation with local experts remains crucial to ensure applicability to specific contexts.
